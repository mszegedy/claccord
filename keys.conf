#### keys.conf

### Individual key names are specified using evdev's names minus the "KEY_" up
### front. So, if evdev refers to a key as "KEY_A", you should just write "A".

[GeneralSettings]

### GENERAL SETTINGS:
### -----------------
### General variables that need setting:
### ONE_KEY_MODE: true|false
###     When set to 'true', this will stop char key presses from being
###     interpreted together at keyup, and instead have them be interpreted
###     separately at each keydown. This reduces the character set, but may
###     allow you to type faster. Multi-char-key combos become invalid in
###     layout.txt, however; if you want a separate layout.txt for this, then
###     call it 'layout_onekey.txt'.

ONE_KEY_MODE=false

[InputKeys]

### INPUT KEY DEFINITIONS:
### ----------------------
### Each of these defines a set of characters used together for input. The mode
### keys are the modifier keys held down to get different sets of characters,
### while the char keys are the keys that, when pressed and released, produce
### characters.
### It is possible to define three sets of keys for each, the M (middle),
### the U (upper), and L (lower). They don't actually have to be in this order;
### they just have to correspond to M, U, and L in layout.txt, M being the
### default. Each can be any set of 5 keys, or 6 keys if they're char keys, but
### the given keys will always correspond to the pictograms in layout.txt, from
### left to right. See layout.txt for more information on how the individual
### definitions work.

[SpecialChars]

### SPECIAL CHARS DEFINITIONS:
### --------------------------
### Special character sequences that can be invoked by name in layout.txt to
### produce the specified set of characters. To have a key be held down,
### prepend 'DOWN!', and to have it be lifted up, prepend 'UP!'. They should
### start with a +, and be composed of letters and underscores.
