#claccord
Allows advanced, highly-configurable keychording, based on the paradigm
of switching through different "modes" with one hand, and executing
chording combos with the other. It's the best thing I've coded since
sliced bread, and I currently use it to type. It's a bit of a mess at
the moment, but I very much plan to see it through to a
widely-compatible end. Requires the library `evdev` for Python, and must
be run as root. Non-alphanumeric characters don't work in urxvt, because
it grabs the required keys to produce them for some reason.
